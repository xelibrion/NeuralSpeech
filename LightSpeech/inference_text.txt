Now, you know I've always had a great deal of respect for Ukraine, tremendous respect.
So, here's what I'd do to make Ukraine great again, folks: First off, we gotta keep those Russians in check. Nobody messes with Ukraine on my watch, believe me.
I'd make sure Ukraine has the military support it needs to defend itself against any aggression. We're talking top-notch equipment, training, and all the bells and whistles, baby.
But hey, let's not forget diplomacy. I'm a negotiator, a dealmaker, and I'd bring that to the table. I'd sit down with those Russians, look 'em straight in the eye, and say, "Hey, we need to find a peaceful solution here, folks."
I'd work my magic, use my charm, and get them to play nice. Art of the deal, baby.
